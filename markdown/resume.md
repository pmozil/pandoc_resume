## Education

**2022 - 2026 (expected)**

-   **Bachelors, Computer Science**; Ukrainian Catholic University (Lviv)

## Experience

### September 2022 - January 2023: CPU design and development

I designed and developed 4 CPUs in SystemVerilog for the de10-nano devkit,
according to the specification of 4 ISAs. The work also included writing test scripts
written in esoteric assembly and writing documentation for the CPU implementation.

### 2022-2023: Teaching assistant for Discrete Mathematics

At this position, I was responsible for organising course materials,
writing automated tests for laboratory works and assisting students with their studies.

### February 2023 - June 2023: CUDA app development

I designed a program for simulation of patchy particle systems along with The National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.

### 2023-2024: Teaching assistant for Principles of Computer organisation and Architecture of Computer  Systems

At this position, I was responsible for more than the Discrete Mathematics Course -
I edited the course page, organized consultations and (sometimes) lectures and wrote tests
for the students' lab works.


### Google Summer of Code 2024 @ FFmpeg

I developed a hardware-accelerated version of the VC-2 codec decoder
for [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).
This job involved optimising data transfer from CPU to GPU with Vulkan API,
creating optimised compute pipelines and minimizing disk idle time to speed up the VC-2 codec,
as well as writing tests and modifying the build configuration for FFmpeg.

## Technical Experience

### Theoretical knowledge

-   **Internet Protocol**, **User Datagram Protocol**, **Transmission Control Protocol**:
    I have experience with IP, UDP and TCP from the developer level. I am familiar with header formats, and have experience with manual UDP header creation and parsing.

-   **Rounting algorithms**:
    I am familiar with routing algorithms, though I lack practical experience with any dynamic routing algorithms beyond RIP.

-   **Linux OS environment**: I am familiar with linux both on the level of OS development as well as OS usage. I am able to manage a linux system as well as write kernel modules to extend it.

-   **High knowledge of mathematics**: I am familiar with a wide range of mathematical theories:
    **Set-**, **Category-**, **Group-** theories as well as other branches of abstract algebra:
    **Algebraic Topology**, **Differential geometry**, **Classic topology**.
    I am also familiar with applied mathematics: **Measure theory**, **Mathematical analysis**,
    **Probability theory and statistics** and **Distribution theory**.

    I am able to utilize this theoretical knowledge to solve the problems associated with those theories.

-   **Machine Learning**: I am familiar with the theoretical parts of Machine Learning, though I have not yet created projects beyond training a transformer model for a chess engine.

### Projects

-   [**Paraflop** - a vulkan ray tracer](https://github.com/pmozil/paraflop)

-   [**Zot** - a regex engine written in zig](https://github.com/pmozil/zot)

-   [**Monistode** - a project implementing multiple CPUs for educational purposes](https://github.com/monistode)

-   [**Raycasting experiments in Rust**](https://github.com/pmozil/raycasting-experiments)

-   [**Monad implementation with CPP concepts**](https://github.com/pmozil/is_that_a_monad)

-   [**Blendage - a wayland compositor with lua configuration**](https://github.com/pmozil/blendage)

### Programming Languages

-   **C:** I have 4 years of experience with C.
    I am familiar with C and abstractions of C machine.
    I used C for my time at FFmpeg, and I am accustomed to writing modern-style C,
    and have experience with libc.

-   **C++:** I have 3 years of experience with C++, and am profficient with STL and boost.
    I am familliar with most of the C++ standard, with focus on newer parts of it.

-   **X86 assembly:** I have experience with X86 assembly, mostly with SYSV ABI.

-   **SystemVerilog:** I have experience with SystemVerilog and Verilog and I am able to
    design digital circuits with it.

-   **Rust:** I am experienced with Rust and the C/C++ FFI for rust.

-   **CMake**, **make**, **Python**, **bash**, **Zig**

-   Basic knowledge of **ARM assembly**, **Haskell**, **Common Lisp**

### Additional tools

-   **nmap**, **ss**, **tcpdump**

-   **gdb**, **lldb**

-   **yosys**, **Quartus**
