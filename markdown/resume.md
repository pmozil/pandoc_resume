## Education

**2022 - 2026 (expected)**

-   **Bachelors, Computer Science**; Ukrainian Catholic University (Lviv)

## Experience

### September 2022 - January 2023: CPU design and development

I designed and developed 4 CPUs in SystemVerilog for the de10-nano devkit,
according to the specification of 4 ISAs. The work also included writing test scripts
written in esoteric assembly and writing documentation for the CPU implementation.

### February 2023 - June 2023: CUDA app development

I designed a program for simulation of patchy particle systems along with The National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.

### 2023-2024: Teaching assistant for Principles of Computer organisation and Architecture of Computer  Systems

At this position, I was responsible for organising course materials,
writing automated tests for laboratory works and assisting students with their studies.


### Google Summer of Code 2024 @ FFmpeg

I developed a hardware-accelerated version of the VC-2 codec decoder
for [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).
This job involved optimising data transfer from CPU to GPU with Vulkan API,
creating optimised compute pipelines and minimizing disk idle time to speed up the VC-2 codec,
as well as writing tests and modifying the build configuration for FFmpeg.
